<p>MAPC is a 30 year old small business headquartered in Curtis Bay, Maryland on the Patapsco River.&#xA0;&#xA0; MAPC is a design
  and&#xA0;build company with a diverse customer base.&#xA0; MAPC was hired by Kevin Plank, CEO of Under Armour, to design
  and build a fleet of 55 foot water taxis for Baltimore&#x2019;s Harbor fashioned after the traditional deadrise workboat.</p>
<p>The deadrise workboat has been an iconic work boat on the waterfront of the Chesapeake Bay for hundreds of years.&#xA0;&#xA0;
  After visiting the Chesapeake Maritime Museum and seeing the boats &#x201C;in action&#x201D;, MAPC designers came up with
  the new design.&#xA0; These new passenger ferry vessels are&#xA0;equipped with USB ports, special lighting features and
  a distinctly Maryland icon&#xA0;theme to each boat.</p>

<p>Zeke&#x2019;s Coffee is a local, small batch, family owned coffee roastery that is seriously committed to freshness.&#xA0;Zeke&#x2019;s coffee started with a man and a one pound coffee roaster. Thomas Rhodes sold his first pound of coffee at Baltimore Farmers&#x2019; Market in November 2005, and opened a retail space in Lauraville in NE Baltimore on April 22, 2006. On February 26, 2010, we opened our first cafe at 4607 Harford Road. Zeke&#x2019;s can also be found year round at the 32nd Street Market in Waverly and seasonally at several markets in and around Baltimore.</p>
<p>At Zeke&#x2019;s, we use a fluid bed coffee roaster. Invented by Mike&#xA0;Sivetz, a physicist from Oregon in the 1970&#x2019;s, fluid bed coffee roasters use hot air to create a fountain of coffee beans. This technique roasts more quickly and uniformly than a conventional drum roaster. We roast to temperature, giving us a more consistent product. Chaff escapes the roast chamber easily, leading to cleaner tasting coffee with more distinct regional flavors. We roast in small batches. It guarantees freshness. It keeps us honest. Our roaster holds 30 pounds of coffee, compared to the 150 pounds that a standard roaster holds. Because of this, we put more time, more labor, and a little more of ourselves into each bean. You can taste the difference.</p>
